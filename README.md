# ToT Analysis

This report describes the work of estimating Time-on-Task (ToT) value from a small log data. A total of 3 methods has been discussed in this report. The author still believes using in-school-hour data to estimate a problem's ToT would be a better choice if there are enough data points. IQR outlier detection method does not suit for this data set although it is widely used in other scenarios. In the end, we have to rely on a semi-manually process to select a part of the data set to generate an estimated ToT value (9 minutes). Also, it is worth to mention that, accessing more information would be very help on this ToT analysis, such as correctness of students' responses.

To sum up, the author believes that this is a comprehensive analysis of the ToT problem, and it should serve a demonstration of author's abilities in data mining and data analysis.

The 'ToT Analysis.ipynb' is the iPython notebook with all analysis in it. If iPython notebook is unavaiable to open this file, a static file 'ToT Analysis.html' is also avaiable to open in a web browser.
